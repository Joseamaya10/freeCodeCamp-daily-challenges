# Daily Python Challenges üêç

This repository contains my solutions to the **FreeCodeCamp Coding Challenge of the Day**, solved using **Python**.  
The main purpose of this project is to practice coding every single day, stay consistent, and track my progress over time.  
By solving one challenge a day, I aim to strengthen my **problem-solving skills**, improve my understanding of **Python fundamentals**, and build habits that will prepare me for **technical interviews** and **real-world projects**.  
Each challenge comes with its own solution file, and I document everything to keep a clear history of my learning journey.  
Over time, this repository will grow into a collection of small but valuable exercises that reflect my persistence and growth as a programmer.
